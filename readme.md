# Course Manager for McMaster University 
## Introduction:
This is a program that helps users create timetable when they are in the stage of choosing different sections of different courses before a semester begins. Specifically, this program only works for those organizations having the same course structure as McMaster university's.

It should be a client-end program. However, a browser-end should be implemented after the the client-end program is completed and tested.
## Develop Plan:
### Stage 1: 
   - **Task**: implement the most basic but the most important functionalty of the program:
      - big view: given courses, return all possible timetables  
   - choice of language: 
      **Python3**
   - reason for choosing **Python3**: 
      1. easy to read/write a file
      2. some great libraries available ( Pandas, numpy, ... )
